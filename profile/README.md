# About Us

Our journey started with a single application submitted by Kuba, the team leader, who at the time was working alone. From that moment, we have grown into a seven-member team with the opportunity to present our autonomous drone solutions at the finals of one of the world's most prestigious autonomy competitions.

## Over the next five weeks, we:
- Built a prototype test drone  
- Developed navigation software  
- Secured sponsors and partners  
- Organized logistics for the trip  

Thanks to the support of **Waldek Olbryk** and a **crowdfunding campaign**, we raised the necessary funds. We also received **technical mentorship** from **Professor Tomasz Krysiński**, **Przemysław Zakrzewski**, and **Artur Zawadzki (ABB)**.

Despite our efforts, due to time constraints, limited financial resources, and unexpected technical issues from the organizers, **only three out of twenty teams qualified** for the finals. However, a **second round of qualifications** was announced for **January 2025**. Learning from our previous experience, we refined our approach and strengthened our team with **Adam, a PhD candidate from Warsaw University of Technology**. Additional **funding from Porsche Warsaw** allowed us to **return to the UAE**, successfully navigate the course, and secure a place among the **final twelve teams**.

Now, we are focusing on refining our technology and preparing for the **April 2025 finals**, where the **prize pool is $1 million**.

## Our Technology

We are one of the few teams in Poland developing **autonomous flying systems**. Our approach prioritizes:  

✅ **Minimal sensor usage** – a cost-effective, energy-efficient solution allowing for extended flight time.  
✅ **No GPS or external communication** – making the drone resistant to interference and operable in environments without network access.

## The Future

Beyond the competition, we plan to **further develop our system** to meet commercial needs. We are actively involved in the **Warsaw University of Technology accelerator** and seeking opportunities to **present our work to a wider audience**.  

Until April, our **primary focus is on the competition**, but we always remember **why we started**.
